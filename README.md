Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my repository.

## 📖 About This Project
I am currently a beginner learning Data Science and Machine Learning. This repository serves as my "Digital Notebook" where I experiment with tools, train models, and explore Deep Learning.
My main focus here is understanding how to build models from scratch and how to leverage powerful **pre-trained models** using TensorFlow.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
These are the key tools I am using:

* **TensorFlow / Keras:** For Deep Learning and using pre-trained models.
* **Python:** The main programming language.
* **NumPy & Pandas:** For data handling.
* **Matplotlib:** For visualizing model performance (accuracy/loss graphs).

## 📂 Project Highlights

### 1. 🧠 Training Models
* Building simple Neural Networks (ANNs) from scratch.
* Experimenting with layers, activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid), and optimizers (Adam, SGD).

### 2. 🚀 Transfer Learning (Pre-trained Models)
* Using state-of-the-art models (like **MobileNet**, **ResNet**, or **VGG16**) directly from TensorFlow.
* Fine-tuning these models for custom classification tasks (saving time and computing power!).

## 🎯 Future Goals
* Improve model accuracy using Data Augmentation.
* Deploy a TensorFlow model to a simple web app (using Streamlit).
* Understand the math behind Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
